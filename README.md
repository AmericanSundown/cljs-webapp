# cljs-webapp

A Leiningen template for CLJS webapps.

Comes with two cljsbuild configs - `dev` and `prod`.
There's also an `index.html` including the generated JS.

## Getting started

Create a new project:

    lein new cljs-webapp myapp

Start the auto rebuild loop:

    cd myapp
    lein cljsbuild auto dev

Now open `resources/public/index.html` in a browser either directly or by
running a web server in `resources/public`.
